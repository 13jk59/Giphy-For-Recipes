# API-Recipe-App
## Description
This is an app I built using React and Redux utilizing the free recipe API provided at: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun.

## Notes
Still in progress with features still being added.

## Features
* Pulls 9 random recipes from the API and displays them in grid boxes with associated information
* User can search for recipes using a search feature 
* Favourite feature which supports favouriting recipes and saving them for later 
* Infinite scrolling implemented from scratch, loads 9 new recipes from the API every time the user scrolls to the bottom of the page
